# ClearML Helm Charts for Kubernetes

##  Auto-Magical Experiment Manager & Version Control for AI

Helm charts provided by [Allegro AI](https://clear.ml), ready to launch on Kubernetes using [Kubernetes Helm](https://github.com/helm/helm).

## Introduction

The **clearml-server** is the backend service infrastructure for [ClearML](https://github.com/allegroai/clearml).
It allows multiple users to collaborate and manage their experiments.
By default, **ClearML** is set up to work with the **ClearML** demo server, which is open to anyone and resets periodically. 
In order to host your own server, you will need to install **clearml-server** and point **ClearML** to it.

**clearml-server** contains the following components:

* The **ClearML** Web-App, a single-page UI for experiment management and browsing
* RESTful API for:
    * Documenting and logging experiment information, statistics and results
    * Querying experiments history, logs and results
* Locally-hosted file server for storing images and models making them easily accessible using the Web-App

Use this repository to deploy **clearml-server** on Kubernetes clusters.
